  "query": "For NVIDIA and Microsoft, what were revenue, operating income, and total assets in each year from 2018 to 2020, and how did management in the MD&A and Risk Factors sections explain these trends in terms of their AI strategy, competitive positioning, and supply chain risks?",
  "answer": "# NVIDIA and Microsoft Financial Performance (2018-2020): Analysis of Strategic Positioning and Risk Factors\n\n## Direct Answer\n\nI can provide complete net income data for both companies across 2018-2020, but the available KPI data has significant gaps: Microsoft's revenue figures are missing entirely, NVIDIA's revenue is only available for 2018 ($2.9B), and operating income and total assets are not included in the extracted metrics. The narrative context does provide rich qualitative insights into AI strategy, competitive positioning, and supply chain risks from management's MD&A and Risk Factors sections.\n\n## Financial Data Available\n\n**Microsoft (KPI Snapshot):**\n- Net Income: 2018: $8.9B | 2019: $13.2B | 2020: $11.2B\n\n**NVIDIA (KPI Snapshot):**\n- Revenue: 2018: $2.9B\n- Net Income: 2018: $1.1B | 2019: $567.0M | 2020: $950.0M\n\nThe data shows Microsoft's net income grew 48% from 2018 to 2019 before declining 15% in 2020, while NVIDIA experienced a significant net income contraction of 48% in 2019 before partial recovery in 2020.\n\n## AI Strategy and Competitive Positioning\n\n**NVIDIA's AI Focus:** Management emphasized aggressive expansion into AI and datacenter markets. In fiscal 2018, NVIDIA reported that \"datacenter revenue, including Tesla, GRID and DGX, increased 133%, reflecting strong demand from hyperscale and cloud customers for deep learning training and accelerated GPU computing as well as demand for HPC, DGX AI supercomputing and GRID virtualization platforms\" [NVDA, FY 2018, Item 7: MD&A]. This datacenter momentum continued into 2019, with \"datacenter revenue...increased 52%, reflecting strong sales of our Volta architecture products, including NVIDIA Tesla V100 and DGX systems\" [NVDA, FY 2019, Item 7: MD&A].\n\n**Microsoft's Cloud and AI Integration:** Microsoft's 2020 MD&A highlighted that \"Intelligent Cloud revenue increased, driven by server products and cloud services\" and \"Productivity and Business Processes revenue increased, driven by Office Commercial and LinkedIn,\" indicating a diversified approach to AI embedded across multiple business segments rather than a dedicated AI platform strategy [MSFT, FY 2020, Item 7: MD&A].\n\n## Supply Chain and Operational Risks\n\nNVIDIA management disclosed substantial supply chain vulnerabilities and inventory challenges. The 2018-2019 period revealed critical risks: \"fluctuations in the demand for our products related to cryptocurrencies\" and \"our inability to adjust spending to offset revenue shortfalls due to the multi-year development cycle for some of our products and services\" were explicitly cited as operational risks [NVDA, FY 2018, Item 1A: Risk Factors]. \n\nMore concretely, NVIDIA's 2019 MD&A revealed inventory management challenges: \"during a portion of fiscal year 2019, we shipped a higher amount of desktop gaming GPU products relative to where end user demand turned out to be and subsequently compensated by shipping a lower amount of desktop gaming GPU products relative to end user demand to allow the channel to work down that inventory\" [NVDA, FY 2019, Item 7: MD&A]. This inventory correction directly contributed to the 48% net income decline in 2019 despite revenue growth of 21%.\n\nBy 2020, NVIDIA recorded \"inventory provisions totaled $161 million...compared to $270 million for fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively,\" indicating management's efforts to address prior-year excess inventory [NVDA, FY 2020, Item 7: MD&A].\n\n## Data Limitations\n\nThe provided KPI snapshot does not include revenue figures for Microsoft in any year, operating income for either company, or total assets for either company. Additionally, the narrative excerpts do not contain explicit discussion of total assets or operating income trends. To fully answer your question regarding these three metrics across all three years, additional data extraction would be required from the original 10-K filings.",

supercomputing for autonomous robots, drones, and cars, as well as for game consoles and mobile gaming and entertainment devices.\n\nHeadquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998.\n\nRecent Developments, Future Objectives and Challenges Fiscal Year 2019 Summary Revenue for fiscal year 2019 increased 21% year over year, reflecting growth in each of our market platforms - gaming, professional visualization, datacenter, and automotive.\n\nGPU business revenue was $10.17 billion, up 25% from a year earlier.\n\nTegra Processor business revenue - which includes automotive, SOC modules for gaming platforms, and embedded edge AI platforms - was $1.54 billion, up slightly from a year ago.\n\nGaming revenue was $6.25 billion, up 13% from a year ago driven by growth in gaming GPUs.\n\nGaming GPU growth was fueled by Turing-based GPUs for desktops and by gaming notebooks based on our Max-Q technology.\n\nWe also believe that deteriorating macroeconomic conditions, particularly in China have impacted consumer demand for our GeForce gaming GPU products.\n\nIn addition, sales of certain high-end GeForce gaming GPUs using our new Turing architecture that we released during fiscal year 2019 were lower than we expected for the launch of a new architecture.\n\nAs a result, during a portion of fiscal year 2019, we shipped a higher amount of desktop gaming GPU products relative to where end user demand turned out to be and subsequently compensated by shipping a lower amount of desktop gaming GPU products relative to end user demand to allow the channel to work down that inventory.\n\nFor fiscal year 2020, we expect our Gaming revenue to be slightly down compared to fiscal year 2019, with expected growth from sales of Turing-based GPU products and notebook GPU products partially offsetting decreases that we believe were caused by the previously-noted factors.\n\nProfessional visualization revenue was $1.13 billion, up 21% from a year earlier driven by strength across both desktop and mobile workstation products.\n\nDatacenter revenue was $2.93 billion, up 52% from a year ago, led by strong sales of our Volta architecture-based products, including NVIDIA Tesla V100 and DGX systems.\n\nToward the end of fiscal year 2019, we believe that customers across broad-based vertical markets and geographies became increasingly cautious due to economic uncertainty, and a number of Datacenter deals did not close.\n\nIf information becomes available that causes us to determine that a loss in any of our pending litigation, investigations or settlements is probable, and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated with such events, we will record the loss in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\n\nHowever, the actual liability in any such litigation or investigation may be materially different from our estimates, which could require us to record additional costs.\n\nResults of Operations The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain items in our Consolidated Statements of Income expressed as a percentage of revenue.\n\nRevenue Revenue by Reportable Segments GPU Business.\n\nGPU business revenue increased by 25% in fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018.\n\nThis increase was due primarily to 18% growth in sales of GeForce GPU products for gaming, driven by initial sales of Turing-based GPUs for desktops and by high-performance notebooks based on our Max-Q technology.\n\nDatacenter revenue, including Tesla, GRID and DGX, increased 52%, reflecting strong sales of our Volta architecture products, including NVIDIA Tesla V100 and DGX systems.\n\nRevenue from Quadro GPUs for professional visualization increased 21% due primarily to higher sales across desktop and mobile workstation products.\n\nCost of revenue also includes development costs for license and service arrangements and stock-based compensation related to personnel associated with manufacturing.\n\nOur overall gross margin was 61.2%, 59.9%, and 58.8% for fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.\n\nThe increase in fiscal year 2019 reflects our continued shift toward higher-value platforms, which more than offset the impact of approximately $128 million in charges for excess DRAM and other components we recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 and a charge of $57 million we recorded during the third quarter of fiscal year 2019 related to prior architecture components and chips.\n\nThe increase in fiscal year 2018 was driven primarily by a favorable shift in mix, the growth of our GeForce gaming GPU revenue, and the growth of our datacenter revenue for cloud, deep learning, AI, and graphics virtualization.\n\nThe increase in fiscal year 2018 was partially offset by the conclusion of our patent license agreement with Intel in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018.\n\nInventory provisions totaled $270 million, $48 million, and $62 million for fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.\n\nSales of inventory that was previously written-off or written-down totaled $41 million, $35 million, and $51 million for fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.\n\n\n=== [NVDA] NVIDIA CORP | FY 2020 | Doc: 0001045810_10-K_2020 | Item 15: Exhibits and Financial Statement

relations website, http://investor.nvidia.com.\n\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain items in our Consolidated Statements of Income expressed as a percentage of revenue.\n\nRevenue Revenue by Reportable Segments GPU Business.\n\nGPU business revenue decreased by 7% in fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019, which reflects a decline in GPUs sold for gaming.\n\nGeForce GPU product sales for gaming decreased by 10%, reflecting lower sales of GeForce desktop GPUs and SoCs for gaming platforms, partially offset by growth in GeForce notebook GPUs.\n\nRevenue from Quadro GPUs for professional visualization increased by 7%, reflecting strength in desktop and notebook workstations.\n\nData Center revenue, which includes Tesla, GRID and DGX, increased by 2%, driven by vertical industry growth partially offset by lower hyperscale sales.\n\nTegra Processor Business.\n\nTegra Processor business revenue decreased by 6% in fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019.\n\nThis was driven by a decline in revenue from SoCs for gaming platforms, which was partially offset by an increase of 9% in Automotive revenue, reflecting growth in AI cockpit solutions and development services agreements.\n\nConcentration of Revenue Revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States accounted for 92% and 87% of total revenue for fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\nRevenue by geographic region is allocated to individual countries based on the location to which the products are initially billed even if the revenue is attributable to end customers in a different location.\n\nDell represented approximately 11% of our total revenue for fiscal year 2020 and was attributable to the GPU business.\n\nNo customer represented 10% or more of total revenue for fiscal year 2019.\n\nGross Profit and Gross Margin Gross profit consists of total revenue, net of allowances, less cost of revenue.\n\nCost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors purchased from subcontractors, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging, board and device costs, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated with such purchases, final test yield fallout, inventory and warranty provisions, memory and component costs, and shipping costs.\n\nCost of revenue also includes development costs for license and service arrangements and stock-based compensation related to personnel associated with manufacturing.\n\nOur overall gross margin was 62.0% and 61.2% for fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\nThe increase in fiscal year 2020 was driven by reduced inventory provisions and the sale of previously written-off components.\n\nInventory provisions totaled $161 million and $270 million for fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\nSales of inventory that was previously written-off or written-down totaled $145 million and $41 million for fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\nAs a result, the overall net effect on our gross margin was insignificant in fiscal year 2020 and an unfavorable impact of 2.0% in fiscal year 2019.\n\nA discussion of our gross margin results for each of our reportable segments is as follows: GPU Business.\n\nThe gross margin of our GPU business increased during fiscal year 2020 when compared to fiscal year 2019, primarily driven by reduced inventory provisions and the sale of previously written-off components.\n\nTegra Processor Business.\n\nThe gross margin of our Tegra Processor business was relatively flat during fiscal year 2020 when compared to fiscal year 2019.\n\nOperating Expenses Research and Development Research and development expenses increased by 19% in fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019, driven primarily by employee additions and increases in employee compensation and other related costs, including infrastructure costs and stock-based compensation expense.\n\n\n\n\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\nUSER
